
This code is a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of a simple calculator. The HTML code defines a basic structure for the calculator, with a screen area for displaying the input and output, and a series of buttons for entering and performing calculations.

The CSS code defines the styling for the calculator, including the size, position, font, color, and layout of the various elements. The code also includes some basic animation effects for the buttons, such as changing their background color and text color when hovered over or clicked.

The JavaScript code defines the functionality of the calculator, using a series of event listeners to handle user input and perform calculations based on that input. The code includes functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers, as well as for clearing the calculator screen and handling errors.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for building a simple calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By modifying the code and adding additional functionality, it is possible to create more advanced calculator applications with additional features and capabilities.
